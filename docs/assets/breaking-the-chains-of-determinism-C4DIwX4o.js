By verifying that each token selection falls within the model’s expected probability distribution, we ensure tamper-proof AI inferences across diverse hardware configurations. This advancement removes previous constraints and significantly enhances performance, model compatibility, and decentralization."}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"Now, let's dive into the details of how this works and what makes this breakthrough so transformative."}),`
`,e.jsx(n.h2,{children:"A Quick Refresher on the OPoC Consensus Algorithm"}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"The UOMI network's nodes provide both AI computation and economic security. Each validation node is equipped with 48GB of GPU RAM to run AI inferences and must stake UOMI tokens, which are subject to slashing if a validator attempts to propagate a malicious AI inference."}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"Under the OPoC consensus algorithm, a random subset of nodes is selected for validation with each AI inference request. If all selected nodes agree on the result, the inference is validated and propagated. If there is disagreement, computation scales to the honest majority, and any malicious nodes (those disagreeing with the majority result) are slashed."}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"The core assumption behind this mechanism is that AI computations are deterministic and reproducible, meaning the same input should yield the same output across different machines. Currently, agreement under OPoC is defined as exact equivalence in outputs among validators."}),`
`,e.jsx(n.h2,{children:"The Challenge: Indeterminism in AI Computation"}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"This is where complexity arises. Many AI computations—particularly those involving Large Language Models (LLMs)—are not perfectly reproducible due to floating point approximations that accumulate and amplify within transformer layers. This issue is especially pronounced when computations are performed on different hardware architectures."}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"To understand why this happens, let’s break down the transformer architecture into four key simplified stages:"}),`
`,e.jsx(n.h3,{children:"1. Tokenizer"}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"The input text is converted into a sequence of numerical token IDs using a pretrained tokenizer."}),`
`,e.jsx(n.h3,{children:"2. Hidden State Generation"}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"The transformer architecture generates embeddings, applies multi-head self-attention, and passes the data through a feed-forward neural network. During these operations, floating point rounding discrepancies accumulate, particularly when different hardware processes the model."}),`
`,e.jsx(n.h3,{children:"3. Vocabulary Projection (Logits Calculation)"}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"The hidden state is projected onto the vocabulary space, assigning each word a probability of being the next token."}),`
`,e.jsx(n.h3,{children:"4. Next Token Selection"}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"The next word is selected based on the probability distribution. This process falls into two main categories:"}),`
`,e.jsxs(n.ul,{children:[`
`,e.jsxs(n.li,{children:[e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"Greedy & Beam Search"}),": Always selecting the highest-probability word."]}),`

`]}),`
`,e.jsxs(n.p,{children:["It is at this final step—",e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"Next Token Selection"}),"—where indeterminism emerges. Even with a fixed random seed and model quantization small rounding discrepancies in logits calculations, combined with high temperature settings, can lead to divergent results, especially over long outputs. Since transformers are ",e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"autoregressive"})," (each new token is fed back as input), even a single token selection variation can lead to drastically different outputs."]}),`
`,e.jsx(n.h2,{children:"The Current Limitation: Forced Determinism"}),`
`,e.jsxs(n.p,{children:["To circumvent this issue, the current OPoC consensus algorithm enforces ",e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"greedy token selection"}),", ensuring deterministic outputs.

`,e.jsxs(n.p,{children:["However, forcing determinism comes at a cost. Many models—especially advanced reasoning models like ",e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"DeepSeek"}),"—perform significantly worse without temperature scaling and random sampling, limiting the ",e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"quality and diversity of AI-generated content"}),"."]}),`
`,e.jsx(n.h2,{children:"The Research Breakthrough: A New Validation Paradigm"}),`
`,e.jsxs(n.p,{children:["Until now, the OPoC consensus model relied on strict output equivalence to ensure inference integrity.

Instead of enforcing strict output equivalence, validators compute the ",e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"Top-K probability distribution"})," for each token in the output. The validation step now ensures that the next token selected by OPoC_0 falls within this Top-K set."]}),`
`]}),`
`,e.jsxs(n.p,{children:["This innovation ",e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"preserves inference integrity while unlocking full LLM capabilities"}),". Since every token selection is verified against the model’s probable outputs, inference results remain secure and resistant to tampering—even when using ",e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"random sampling and temperature scaling"}),"."]}),`
`,e.jsxs(n.p,{children:["Additional security measures, such as ",e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"total probability mass checks"})," and ",e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"fixed random number seeds for sampling"}),", further strengthen the validation process."]}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"Not only a potential attacker would have only the Top K tokens space to try to sway model’s behaviour, with an output that would still remain in the normal space of possible model’s behaviour - the distribution is usually highly skewed and heavy-tailed, meaning that few tokens are given a large portion of the overall probability mass - but the fixed random sampling number would further reduce this space inside the Top K distribution. Finally for each additional token in the output the difficulty for the output manipulation grows exponentially."}),`
